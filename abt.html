              "Sports inspire purposeful and meaningful social relationships. These social interactions with your friends and fellow sportsmen and sports women provide every one of you the best sportsmanship, security, belongingness and ultimately happiness. Therefore, success or failure in sports is not important, but the happiness originating by means of participating in sports is ever memorable.  The youth fraternity at SKCET are educated, enlightened and empowered through the concepts of human values and leadership qualities to shape the future world. We offer our strong support in bringing out hidden talents in our students through extracurricular activities. It is my privileges to conduct Covai TIES 2018 Inter Engineering College Sports and Games in our Campus.
